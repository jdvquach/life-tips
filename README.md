## Technical Requirements:

* Have at least 3 models (more if they make sense) â€“ one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app.
* Include sign up/log in functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.
* Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE (this just means the standard CRUD routes you have been learning to use).
* Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure and interact with your relationally-stored data (i.e., ActiveRecord).
* Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process (optional).
* Have semantically clean HTML and CSS.
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public (we will show you how to do this during project week).
* Ideally use an API or gem to extend the functionality of your site.
